<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Graham cracker crumbs: Forms the base of the crust, providing a sweet, crumbly texture.</li>
    <li>Butter: Binds the graham cracker crumbs together and adds richness to the crust.</li>
    <li>Sugar: Sweetens both the crust and the filling, balancing the tang of the cream cheese and lemon.</li>
    <li>Salt: Enhances the flavors of both the crust and filling.</li>
    <li>Cream cheese: The key ingredient of the filling, it provides the rich, creamy texture and tangy flavor. I recommend using a good brand, like Philadelphia.</li>
    <li>All-purpose flour: While it may seem unusual in a cheesecake, the flour is the secret to success. A little starch helps prevent cracking and makes the filling lighter and fluffier.</li>
    <li>Vanilla extract: Adds warmth and enhances the sweetness of the filling.</li>
    <li>Lemon zest and juice: Adds a subtle brightness and tang that cuts through the richness of the cream cheese.</li>
    <li>Eggs: Give the cheesecake its structure and help it set while maintaining a smooth texture.</li>
    <li>Sour cream: Adds extra creaminess and a slight tang, balancing the sweetness.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Prep the pan and preheat the oven: Set the oven to 375°F. Wrap the springform pan with two layers of heavy-duty foil, covering the bottom and sides. Spray the inside with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
    <li>Make the graham cracker crust: In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, sugar, and salt; stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Press the crumbs into an even layer on the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake the crust for 10 minutes, until set.</li>
    <li>Make the cheesecake batter: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or beaters, combine the cream cheese, sugar, and flour.</li>
    <li>Beat on medium speed until just smooth, about 1 minute, then mix in the vanilla, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt.</li>
    <li>With the mixer on low, add the eggs, one at a time, mixing until incorporated, scraping the bowl as necessary. Then add the sour cream and mix until the batter is uniform.</li>
    <li>Pour the batter on top of the crust.</li>
    <li>Place the unbaked cheesecake in a large roasting pan and add boiling water to the pan, about an inch up the sides of the springform. This water bath, or bain marie, ensures even, gentle baking and helps prevent cracking or drying. Bake the cheesecake at 325°F until it’s just set; it should not appear liquid, but will slightly wobble when gently nudged, as it will continue to cook as it cools.</li>
    <li>Remove the roasting pan from the oven and cool the cheesecake in the water bath on a wire rack for 45 minutes. Then, remove the springform pan, discard the foil, and refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 8 hours or overnight.</li>
    <li>Slice with a sharp knife, wiping clean between cuts. Serve with berry sauce, if you like. Cheesecake can be made up to two days ahead of time, or frozen for up to 3 months.</li>
